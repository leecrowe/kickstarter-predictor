# Kickstarter Campaign Predictions 

## 👋 About Our App:

We used a kickstarter dataset that was originally collected from [kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/) and that is being utilized to generate predictions of whether or not a business will succeed based on factors such as amount of money pledged, what the business' goal is/was, the country they occured in and many more.

## ☝️ Our Proposal:

Is it possible to make relatively accurate predictions on whether or not a kickstarter campaign will fail or succeed?

## 💡 Key Features:

The model used in this app is trained using Random Forest Regressor and is a dash app that has been deployed on heroku.

## 🧮 About the Data:

The data we had to work with was a list of over 350,000 recent Kickstarter campaigns obtained from Kaggle but collected from the Kickstarter platform, with their features available in a tabular format. The features of these campaigns included, but were not limited to, title, country, main category, success state, monetary goal, amount of money pledged, and the number of backers. A link to the dataset can be found  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects).
